This project shows how to set up your Xcode project to use [StorybookComposer](https://github.com/NSFatalError/StorybookComposer).
With `StorybookComposerPlugin` you will be able to automatically add your SwiftUI components from your UI library and catalogue them in a separate Storybook app for showcase and testing.
